You overcome a sudden feeling of insignificance as you gaze upon Hamidon's creation."
"P1553680109" "Humanity is a creature who builds. It finds virgin territory and makes its mark. The Shadow Shard is no different. Even in the short time since it was discovered, a flood of construction material made its way through the dimensional membrane into the Shadow Shard and the building began. The crews met the unearthly challenges that faced them and established numerous military facilities in this strange territory. There is something almost surreal about seeing this construction crane, something so commonplace on Earth here in an alien dimension: the mundane meeting the unearthly."

Late at night, minions of the Banished Pantheon have been spotted congregating around this gravesite, leading the Council to believe they exhumed it. But others in the Council believe that whatever was in the grave emerged under its own power, and that such a being could have called the Banished Pantheon to the Isle for some unknown purpose.
